# Architecture Hub

This directory contains auto-generated architecture documentation for the circl-dev organization repositories.

## Structure

Each repository gets a `{repo-name}.arch.md` file documenting:
- Module structure and dependencies
- Key architectural patterns
- API endpoints and integration points
- Data models and relationships

## Generated by

[Repo-Swarm](../repo-swarm/) - AI-powered multi-repo architecture discovery platform

## Usage

These `.arch.md` files are automatically anchored into feature specs to provide context for implementation planning.

## Regenerating

To update architecture docs:

```bash
cd ../repo-swarm
source .env.local
mise investigate-all
```
